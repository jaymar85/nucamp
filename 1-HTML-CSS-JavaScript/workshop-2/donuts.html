      A doughnut or donut is a type of <strong>deep fried</strong> dough
      confectionery or dessert food. The doughnut is popular in many countries
      and prepared in various forms as a sweet snack that can be homemade or
      purchased in bakeries, supermarkets, food stalls, and franchised specialty
      outlets.
    </p>
    <p class="fact">Did you know? Donut can also be spelled "doughnut".</p>

    <p>
      The two most common types are <strong>toroidal ring doughnut</strong> and
      the <strong>filled doughnut</strong>, which is injected with fruit
      preserves, cream, custard, or other sweet fillings. Alternatively, small
      pieces of dough are sometimes cooked as doughnut holes. Other shapes
      include rings, balls, and flattened sphere, as well as ear shapes, twist
      and other forms. Doughnut varieties are also divided into cake and risen
      type doughnuts.
